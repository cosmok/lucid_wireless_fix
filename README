==Why?==
After my upgrade to Kubuntu Lucid Lynx, I (like many others) started experiencing dropouts on my wireless connection.
None of the suggested solutions( mainly on the Ubuntu forums) worked for me.
This is just a quick hack until the cause for this gets fixed by the Ubuntu devs.

==Requirements==
needs cnetworkmanager (http://vidner.net/martin/software/cnetworkmanager/) to be downloaded, the source archive contains the binary.
bash (haven't tested in other shells but, it might work)

==Usage==
Example:

1.
./fix-wireless.sh
./fix-wireless.sh --help
./fix-wireless.sh -h

to get the usage instructions

2.
./fix-wireless.sh google.com myssid mywpapasswordformyssid /home/cmetworkmanager

where google.com is the domain that I want to ping to see if I am coonected to internet or not
mysssid is my wireless network name
mywpapasswordformyssid is the WPA[2] password for the above network
/home/cmetworkmanager is the directory containing the cnetworkmanager executable
