==Why?==
After my upgrade to Kubuntu Lucid Lynx, I (like many others) started experiencing dropouts on my wireless connection.
None of the suggested solutions( mainly on the Ubuntu forums) worked for me.
This is just a quick hack until the cause for this gets fixed by the Ubuntu devs.

==Requirements==
needs cnetworkmanager (http://vidner.net/martin/software/cnetworkmanager/) to be downloaded, the source archive contains the binary.
bash (haven't tested in other shells but, it might work)

==Usage==
Examples:

1.
./fix-wireless.sh
./fix-wireless.sh --help
./fix-wireless.sh -h

to get the usage instructions

2.
./fix-wireless.sh google.com myssid mywpapasswordformyssid /home/cmetworkmanager

where google.com is the domain that I want to ping to see if I am coonected to internet or not
mysssid is my wireless network name
mywpapasswordformyssid is the WPA[2] password for the above network
/home/cmetworkmanager is the directory containing the cnetworkmanager executable

==Troubleshooting===

1.I get the following error: Another applet is running: Bus name already exists: org.freedesktop.NetworkManagerUserSettings (pid 1681)
Fix: kill the pid and try again

2.I use WEP
Look at the usage for cnetworkmanager (cnetworkmanager -h)  and modify the line containing --wpa-pass in the fix-wireless.sh script

3.Even after running the script, I seem to have periods where there is no connectivity
Maybe your droputs are more frequent. Lower the sleepInterval variable in the script.
For e.g., set it to "30s" to check for connectivity every 30 seconds
